# PhotoConverter
Code for convert Tie Points from Agisoft Photoscan to Erdas LPS file format.

This project is still under development, so be careful when using.

The code receives a txt from Photoscan with Photo identifiers and a large set of tie points observed per photo and converts it to a LPS file format, so this points and photos can be loaded on LPS.
